I'm a graduate student at [University of Washington, Seattle](https://www.washington.edu/){:target="_blank"} in the [Electrical and Computer Engineering Department](https://www.ece.uw.edu/){:target="_blank"}.


Previously I was a research fellow working with [Prof. C.V Jawahar](https://faculty.iiit.ac.in/~jawahar/){:target="_blank"} at the Applied Research Lab, [CVIT, IIIT-Hyderabad](https://cvit.iiit.ac.in){:target="_blank"} and [Prof. Vinod](https://faculty.iiit.ac.in/~vinod.pk/){:target="_blank"}. I worked on Histopahological Analysis of Kidney Carcinoma images deriving relevant inferences such as detection of Cancer and its subtypes and predicting the survival outcome using Deep learning.


I was also a mentor for the [Deep learning Certificate program](https://www.greatlearning.in/deep-learning-certificate-program){:target="_blank"} by [Great Learning](https://www.greatlearning.in/){:target="_blank"}. I was responsible for undertaking live sessions teaching concepts of Machine Learning and Computer vision and grading of Assignments.

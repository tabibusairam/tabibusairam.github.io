I'm currently a research fellow working with [Prof. C.V Jawahar](https://faculty.iiit.ac.in/~jawahar/){:target="_blank"} at the Applied Research Lab, [CVIT, IIIT-Hyderabad](https://cvit.iiit.ac.in){:target="_blank"} and [Prof. Vinod](https://faculty.iiit.ac.in/~vinod.pk/){:target="_blank"}. I'm working on Histopahological Analysis of Kidney Carcinoma images deriving relevant inferences such as detection of Cancer and its subtypes and predicting the survival outcome using Deep learning.

I graduated from [IIT BHU, India](http://www.iitbhu.ac.in/){:target="_blank"}, in 2017 with a Bachelors Degree in Electronics Engineering.

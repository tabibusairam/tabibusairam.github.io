### Lexical and Visual Analysis to Identify Posts Warranting Empathetic Responses

[**NTU Singapore**](http://www.ntu.edu.sg/Pages/home.aspx) --- under [Prof. Erik Cambria](http://sentic.net/erikcambria/){:target="_blank"}, School of Computer Science and Engineering

We worked on understanding the sentiment that a person elicits on different posts present on different social
media sites, on the topics of abuse or mental health. We propose a method supported by hand-crafted features
to judge if the post requires an empathetic response.
The model is trained upon posts from various web-pages
and corresponding comments, on both the captions and the
Images. We were able to obtain 80% accuracy in tagging
posts requiring empathetic responses.

### Multimodal Analysis for Deception Detection

[**NTU Singapore**](http://www.ntu.edu.sg/Pages/home.aspx) --- under [Dr. Rajiv Bajpai](https://scholar.google.com.sg/citations?user=hHZR1xkAAAAJ&hl=en){:target="_blank"}, School of Computer Science and Engineering

We worked on developing a data driven method for automatic
deception detection in real-life trial data using visual and verbal cues. Using OpenFace with facial action unit recognition, we analyze the movement of facial features of the witness when posed with questions and the acoustic patterns using OpenSmile. We then perform a lexical analysis on the spoken words, emphasizing the use of pauses and utterance breaks, feeding that to a Support Vector Machine to test deceit or truth prediction. We then try out a method to incorporate utterance-based fusion of visual and lexical analysis, using string based matching.

### Infrared image/video processing in the Maritime environment

[** NTU, Singapore**](http://www.ntu.edu.sg/Pages/home.aspx) --- under [Prof. Deepu Rajan](http://www3.ntu.edu.sg/home/ASDRajan/){:target="_blank"}, School of Computer Science and Engineering

Worked on Detecting and tracking ships, boats, frigates using IR cameras along the Singapore coastline with every possible variation in orientation,shape, distance and surrounding effects. Selective search using graph methods and combining them on the basis of several similarity measures such as color shape to get probable Bounding boxes. CNN used to extract features and SVM’s to classify them .

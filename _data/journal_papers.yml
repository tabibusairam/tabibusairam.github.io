  description: <ul><li>Histopathological images contain morphological markers of disease progression that have diagnostic and </li>
               <li>predictive values. In this study, we demonstrate how deep learning framework can be used for an automatic </li>
               <li>classification of Renal Cell Carcinoma (RCC) subtypes, and for identification of features that predict </li>
               <li>survival outcome from digital histopathological images. Convolutional neural networks (CNNâ€™s) trained on whole-slide </li>
               <li>images distinguish clear cell and chromophobe RCC from normal tissue with a classification accuracy of 93.39% and 87.34%,</li>
               <li>respectively. Further, a CNN trained to distinguish clear cell, chromophobe and papillary RCC achieves a classification</li>
               <li>accuracy of 94.07%. Here, we introduced a novel support vector machine-based method that helped to break the multi-class</li>
               <li>classification task into multiple binary classification tasks which not only improved the performance of </li>
               <li>the model but also helped to deal with data imbalance. Finally, we extracted the morphological features</li>
               <li>from high probability tumor regions identified by the CNN to predict patient survival outcome of most common clear</li>
               <li>cell RCC. The generated risk index based on both tumor shape and nuclei features are significantly associated</li>
               <li>with patient survival outcome. These results highlight that deep learning can play a role in both cancer diagnosis</li>
               <li> and prognosis.</li><ul>

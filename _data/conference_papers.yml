- title: Hang in There - Lexical and Visual Analysis to Identify Posts Warranting Empathetic Responses
  image:  FLAIRS.jpeg
  description: <ul><li>In the past few years, social media has risen as a platform
where people express and share personal incidences about
abuse, violence and mental health issues. There is a need to
pinpoint such posts and learn the kind of response expected.
For this purpose, we understand the sentiment that a personal
story elicits on different posts present on different social
media sites, on the topics of abuse or mental health. In this
paper, we propose a method supported by hand-crafted features
to judge if the post requires an empathetic response.
The model is trained upon posts from various web-pages
and corresponding comments, on both the captions and the
images. We were able to obtain 80% accuracy in tagging
posts requiring empathetic responses. </li></ul>

- title: The Truth and Nothing but the Truth - Multimodal Analysis for Deception Detection
  image:  ICDM.jpg
  description: <ul><li>We propose a data-driven method for automatic
deception detection in real-life trial data using visual and verbal
cues. Using OpenFace with facial action unit recognition, we
analyze the movement of facial features of the witness when
posed with questions and the acoustic patterns using OpenSmile.
We then perform a lexical analysis on the spoken words,
emphasizing the use of pauses and utterance breaks, feeding that
to a Support Vector Machine to test deceit or truth prediction.
We then try out a method to incorporate utterance-based fusion
of visual and lexical analysis, using string based matching.</li></ul>
